# Star Wars: Attack of the Programming Interfaces

Use the force to find the droids you're looking for. Or better yet, using axios and [The Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) to find anyone in a galaxy far, far away.

## Summary

The Star Wars API is a data source for the data from the Star Wars canon universe. Axios is the npm library being used to query the API and retrieve the data, with React.js and Bootstrap presenting all the information in a neat manner. The entire application is hosted on Heroku.

I learned about the importance of 'https' in the URL when making the API call. I kept running into the CORS policy issue simply trying to run the urls as 'http'. The 'await' expression in JavaScript was also essential for this project. Without it, everything tries to execute at once, and fails to acheive anything other than errors. As a young padawan, I have much to learn. Patience, I must have.
